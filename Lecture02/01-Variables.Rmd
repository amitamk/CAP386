```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```
## Assignments

These are three ways we can do assignments:

```{r}
a <- 10
b = 20
30 -> c
```

## Reading Variables
These are some of the ways we can inspect the variables' values:

```{r}
print(a)
b
cat(c)
```

## Listing and Removing Variables

```{r error=TRUE}
ls()
rm(b)
print(b)
```
